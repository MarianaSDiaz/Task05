                        Campaigners have described the resignation of Pride in London’s co-chairs and senior directors 
                        as a landmark moment for the body and called for a fundamental rethink of how the UK’s largest 
                        Pride march operates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Five directors including the co-chairs Michael Salter-Church, who founded the organisation, and 
                        Alison Camps 
                        <a class="links" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/entire-pride-in-london-advisory-board-resigns-bullying-claims">
                            resigned with immediate effect
                        </a> 
                        on Friday following a turbulent week amid allegations
                        of a hostile environment for people of colour and bullying within the organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pride in London said Chris Joell-Deshields, the community engagement director, would take the 
                        position of interim co-chair, with another co-chair to be appointed in the next few days to help
                            manage the process of recruiting permanent co-chairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A transitional board composed of some of the existing members will remain in place over the 
                        coming months. The board will engage with community stakeholders from minority groups to advise 
                        on an action plan that has been created in the last 48 hours to better support of people of colour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A spokesperson for the organisation said: “Pride in London is committed to rebuilding the trust 
                        of minority communities which it knows is broken, but we hope not irreparably. We are aware that 
                        only through immediate and decisive action as well as demonstrable change in the coming weeks and 
                        months can we authentically show its commitment to diverse voices and experiences.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The change in leadership follows the resignation of every member of Pride in London’s community 
                        advisory board (CAB) on Thursday, claiming there was a culture of bullying and a “hostile environment” 
                        for minority ethnic volunteers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board resignations came after several directors stepped down, including the most senior 
                        black volunteer, Rhammel Afflick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afflick, a former director of communications, said: “This is a milestone moment. But the 
                        accountability doesn’t stop here. An entirely new leadership with a robust mandate is needed to 
                        break away from Pride’s long history of getting it wrong for black and brown people in LGBT+ communities.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This month Pride in London said it would 
                        <a class="links" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/05/pride-in-london-rejects-ban-on-met-police-taking-part-in-parade">
                            allow the Metropolitan police 
                        </a>
                        to apply to take part in the annual parade, after calls to ban the force at the height of last 
                        year’s Black Lives Matter protests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In its resignation letter, the CAB, made up of 10 individuals, called for the resignation of 
                        the senior leadership and an independent investigation by the mayor’s office. Their demands 
                        were backed by the LGBT charity Stonewall, which 
                        <a class="links" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/23/stonewall-withdraws-from-pride-in-london-diversity-uk-black-pride">
                            pulled out of the parade in 2018 
                        </a>
                        because of the event’s perceived lack of diversity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ozzy Amir, the former chair and BAME representative of the CAB, criticised the statement 
                        released by Pride in London on Friday about changes to its structure and leadership. “The 
                        Black and people of colour community were owed an apology. Yet nowhere in this self-congratulatory 
                        statement will you see the words ‘sorry’. Nowhere will you see any of the issues on bullying or racism 
                        addressed or even acknowledged.” Afflick had also criticised the most recent statement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He reiterated the call for every director to resign and said: “I welcome the resignations, but
                        there is still a long way to go.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Peter Tatchell, a patron of Pride in London who helped organise the first Pride in the UK in 
                        1972 and has marched in every London parade since, has called for a full independent investigation 
                        from the London assembly into the allegations made by Afflick and the CAB.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tatchell said: “Hopefully these resignations will force a wholesale reform of Pride in London. 
                        For several years it has been losing community support and confidence. Many of us feel that Pride 
                        has lost its way. It is far removed from the original Pride ideals, having become depoliticised 
                        and too commercial. Pride is now characterised by vague, apolitical themes rather than specific 
                        LGBT+ human rights demands.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tatchell criticised the organisation for allowing the Home Office, arms manufacturers and the 
                        police to march in the parade, and a policy that limits the number of people who can join the 
                        parade to just over 30,000 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He said: “It is time Pride reverted to a march for LGBT+ rights, with no motorised floats.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Amir said: “The future of Pride needs to be rooted in our values and it should put our communities 
                        and the struggle for our collective liberation at its heart.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier his week a Pride in London spokesperson said the group wanted to “apologise to our 
                        volunteers and our communities – particularly people of colour and those from Black communities 
                        – for whom we’ve missed the mark in terms of support and inclusion”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The spokesperson added: “We developed a diversity and inclusion strategy last year which we are 
                        in the process of implementing, though we are very much still on this journey.”
                    </p>

                        The spokesperson added: “We developed a diversity and inclusion strategy last year which we are 
                        in the process of implementing, though we are very much still on this journey.”

                        ... as you join us today from Argentina, we have a small favour to ask. You’ve read 5 articles in 
                        the last year. And you’re not alone; through these turbulent and challenging times, millions rely 
                        on the Guardian for independent journalism that stands for truth and integrity. Readers chose to 
                        support us financially more than 1.5 million times in 2020, joining existing supporters in 180 countries.

                    <p>
                        For 2021, we commit to another year of high-impact reporting that can counter misinformation 
                        and offer an authoritative, trustworthy source of news for everyone. With no shareholders or 
                        billionaire owner, we set our own agenda and provide truth-seeking journalism that’s free from 
                        commercial and political influence. When it’s never mattered more, we can investigate and challenge 
                        without fear or favour.

                        Unlike many others, we have maintained our choice: to keep Guardian journalism open for all 
                        readers, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. We do this because we believe 
                        in information equality, where everyone deserves to read accurate news and thoughtful analysis. Greater 
                        numbers of people are staying well-informed on world events, and being inspired to take meaningful action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the last year alone, we offered readers a comprehensive, international perspective on critical 
                        events – from the Black Lives Matter protests, to the US presidential election, Brexit, and the 
                        ongoing pandemic. We enhanced our reputation for urgent, powerful reporting on the climate emergency, 
                        and made the decision to reject advertising from fossil fuel companies, divest from the oil and gas 
                        industries, and set a course to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
